Released in 1979, Platinum was Oldfield's first album for Virgin Records after leaving his previous label. It was also his first album to feature vocals on more than one track, as well as guest musicians such as Phil Collins, David Bedford and Sally Oldfield. The album consists of four parts: Airborn, Platinum, Charleston and North Star/Platinum Finale. Each part showcases a different aspect of Oldfield's musical talent and vision.
 
Airborn is a soaring instrumental piece that combines synthesizers, guitars and percussion in a symphonic arrangement. Platinum is a four-part suite that explores various styles and genres, from rock to jazz to funk to classical. Charleston is a playful homage to the 1920s dance craze, featuring horns, piano and vocals by Wendy Roberts. North Star/Platinum Finale is a stunning finale that blends Oldfield's original composition with a cover of Philip Glass's minimalist masterpiece North Star.
 
In 2012, Platinum was reissued as a 2CD deluxe edition, remastered by Oldfield himself. The second disc contains bonus tracks, such as live versions, alternate mixes and unreleased material. The deluxe edition also includes a booklet with liner notes, photos and lyrics.
 
If you are a fan of Mike Oldfield or progressive rock in general, you should not miss this opportunity to rediscover Platinum in its full glory. This album is a testament to Oldfield's genius and creativity, and a timeless classic that will never cease to amaze you.
  
Platinum was a pivotal album in Oldfield's career, as it marked a departure from his previous long-form compositions and a move towards shorter and more diverse tracks. It also reflected his personal and artistic growth, as he experimented with new sounds and influences. Platinum was well received by critics and fans alike, and reached number five on the UK Albums Chart.
 
One of the highlights of Platinum is the collaboration with Phil Collins, who played drums and sang on two tracks: Platinum Part 3 (Charleston) and Platinum Part 4 (North Star/Platinum Finale). Collins was a fan of Oldfield's music and had met him at a charity concert in 1978. The two musicians hit it off and decided to work together on Oldfield's next album. Collins later said that he enjoyed working with Oldfield and that he learned a lot from him.
 
Another notable feature of Platinum is the use of the Fairlight CMI, one of the first digital synthesizers and samplers. Oldfield was fascinated by the possibilities of the Fairlight, which allowed him to create sounds and textures that were impossible to achieve with conventional instruments. He used the Fairlight extensively on Platinum, especially on Platinum Part 2 (Platinum), where he sampled various instruments and voices, including his own.
